Learning through writing

Learning coding has been extremely useful for me. But as I learn more and become familiar with newer concepts, it is becoming harder to keep track of everything I learned. So that is why i am creating a technical writing page. Solely on the purpose of sharing my knowledge. And to revise and keep tabs on everything I learned.
This is also to keep track of everything using Git
